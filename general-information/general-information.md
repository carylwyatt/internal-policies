## Desk Etiquette

Always greet students with a hello and a smile when they first walk in the library.
- If you need to say “no”, explain why in a calm and respectful manner.
- Always treat the patrons with respect.
- If you are the only one on duty at the Circulation Desk and it is very busy (more than five patrons are waiting) you may ask the office manager or librarian on duty to help you if he/she is free. 
- If you are the only one on duty at the Circulation Desk and you want to leave the work area, either for break or washroom, please let the office manager and/or librarian on duty know. 
- If patrons complain about the library policy or procedure, refer them to the office manager.  If the issue cannot be resolved with the office manager, refer them to the assistant director in charge. 
- At the Circulation Desk, do not engage in lengthy conversations not related to the library with patrons or staff.
- If a patron is rude to you, refer them to the office manager.  If the issue cannot be resolved with the office manager, refer them to the assistant director in charge, or excuse yourself and ask another person on duty to attend to the patron.
- When a patron is upset or demanding, take him/her to the librarian in charge at that time.
- If students want to check out books but do not have IDs, they may use their driver's license one time.  Once they use their driver's license, make a note of the date they used it in a Pop-up window in Voyager, with your initials.
