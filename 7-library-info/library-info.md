###Understanding Call Numbers

Most of our books are arranged according to the Library of Congress (LC) Classification Outline.  
Each book has a unique alpha-numeric call number indicating where it is located in the library.

Call numbers appear one of three ways:  

Like this, on the spines of books:   

            LB              

            2395                         

           .C65

            1991 


You will sometimes see labels combining lines 1 & 2 – LB2395 - and like this, in the online catalog: LB2395 .C65 1991.  The same call number can be written top-to-bottom, or left-to-right.


###Reading Call Numbers

Read a call number by sections, line-by-line.  For example:     

                    LB

                    2395

                    .C65

                    1991

      LB --    Read the first line in alphabetical order:

                   A, B, BF, C, D … L, LA, LB, LC, M, ML …

     2395 – Read the second line as a whole number:

                   1, 2, 3, …45, …100, 101, … 1000, … 2000, …2430, 2431, 2432

    .C65 – The third line is a combination of a letter and numbers.

                   Ø   Read the letter alphabetically: A, B, C, D, E, … Y, Z

                   Ø   Read the letter as a decimal.

                                    e.g. .C65 = .65

                                    e.g. .C724 = .724
      1991 – This is the year the book was published.

                 Chronological order: 1979, 1985, 1991, 1992…


###Putting Call Numbers in Shelf Order

To understand how call numbers are put in order in Library of Congress Classification, again look at each section of the call number.  These call numbers are in the correct order:

1.         LA2301 .M37                                                                         

2.         LB2327 .M3                                                                             

3.         LB2327 .V53 1990                                                                   

4.         LB2328 .B37                                                                          

5.         LB2328 .C34

6.         LB2328 .C55

7.         LB2328 .C554 1982

8.         LB2395 .C65 1987

9.         LB2395 .C65 1991


Could you see why the call numbers were arranged in this order?  Shelf-order can be confusing at first. 

Here is the same list of call numbers, with explanations of how they were put in order:

   1.      LA2301 .M37

   2.      LB2327 .M3 (LB comes after LA)

   3.      LB2327 .V53 1990 (Both start with LB2327, V comes after M)

   4.      LB2328 .B37 (2328 comes after 2327)

   5.      LB2328 .C34 (C comes after B)

   6.      LB2328 .C55 (Both start with LB2328 .C, decimal .55 comes after .34)

   7.      LB2328 .C554 1982 (Decimal .554 comes after .55)

   8.      LB2395 .C65 1987

   9.      LB2395 .C65 1991 (Same call numbers except for date: 1991 comes after 1987)


###What does the call number mean?

Remember that Library of Congress Classification arranges materials by subjects. The first sections of the call number represent the subject of the book. The letter-and-decimal section of the call number often represents the author’s last name. And, as you recall, the last section of a call number is often the date of publication.

Example:

Title: What You Need to Know About Developing Study Skills, Taking Notes & Tests, Using Dictionaries & Libraries

Author: Marcia J. Coman.

Call number:   LB2395 .C65 1991

Let’s examine the sections of this call number:

       LB2395 = subject of the book: Methods of Study in Higher Education

       .C65 = Coman, the author’s last name

       1991 = the publication year

###Why is this important to know?

Because books are classified by subject, you can often find several helpful books on the same shelf, or nearby. For example, within the same call number LB2395, there are other guides for college study.

       LB2395 .C6 1960 – A Student’s Guide to Efficient Study, by Luella Cole

       LB2395 .C65 1991 – What You Need to Know ..., by Marcia J. Coman

       LB2395 .L447 - Keys to College Success, by Minnette Lenier

       LB2395 .O54 1983 - A Successful Student's Handbook, by Rita Phipps

Knowing the letter(s) for your subject area gives you a place to start browsing the shelves.  View the Library of Congress Classification Table to see the subject areas and their letters.
