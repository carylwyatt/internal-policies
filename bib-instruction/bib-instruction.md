#Bibliographic Instruction

##Teaching a One-Shot
The purpose of the Library Bibliographic Instruction Services Program is to support the educational mission of the College by teaching students in all disciplines how to find, select, and evaluate information in such a way that it has relevance to their courses and adds meaning to their lives by encouraging and facilitating intellectual independence and lifelong learning.

If a class instructor incorporates an assignment that requires use of library resources into his/her course, scheduling a library class is encouraged. A library instructor will tailor a class to focus on the skills and strategies required to complete the specific assignment. 

Please note the following:

1. Because the bibliographic instruction session is a collaborative effort between the instructor and library faculty member, ***library policy requires the instructor to be present for the scheduled session.*** 
2. Classes should be scheduled at least 14 days prior to the desired date.
3. The class assignment should be sent to the librarian at least 7 days prior to the library class.
4. Students should bring copies of their library-related assignments with them to the library class.

##Roving and Pop-Ins
Roving Reference is defined as providing reference assistance away from the reference desk and at the point-of-service.  Librarians at Ivy Tech Region 8 libraries have been provided with mobile tablets to use in providing roving reference.

Librarians may rove around their prospective campuses during class-change times, lunch/dinner times, and other times as needed.  Locations vary depending on student concentrations or librarian liaison assignments.

Pop-ins are roving in a class--a quick introduction of yourself and/or library services in a class.  This is not scheduled as a Bibliographic Instruction Session is; these are the result of conversation with faculty.  Pop-ins usually occur during the first month of class each semester in English 111 and IVYT classes.

##Communicating with Faculty
In a September 2015 article in *Library Journal* called **Closing the Gap**, librarians identified four primary, essential services: “instruction of students in information literacy,” “development of collections in direct support of course curricula,” “aiding students one-on-one in conducting research,” and “development of disciplinewide collections.” 

Librarians are each assigned a liaison area that coincides with different Library of Congress areas.  In order to provide these essential services, librarians must communicate with faculty in their liaison areas.

Because of the difficulties of connecting to faculty in the community college setting, with many adjunct and online faculty never stepping foot in the library or the building where the library is located, librarians should consider alternate forms of contact. For example:

- Find faculty names for classes in liaison areas from the Class Schedule Search for the current semester.
- Send an email introducing yourself with contact information to each faculty member at the beginning of each semester.
- Email newsletters each semester or when there is an event/announcement of interest.
- Rove to the faculty offices that are accessible.
- Provide faculty learning sessions, such as Lunch n Learns, that would be interesting to faculty in order to network with participants.
- Attend any and all faculty workshops that are possible in order to become acquainted with faculty.
